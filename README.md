# LinkedList

A linked list implemented in `java` with the following methods:

1. `prepend`
Insert an item at the start of the list. This might just be an instance of insert for you, depending on your implementation, or it might be a different algorithm.
1. `insert`
Insert an item at a specified location. How you specify the location is up to you, but the best choice would be via a linked list node object.
1. `delete`
Removes an item from the list with the given data
1. `length`
(determines the number of elements in the list)
for an added, optional, challenge (for those people working in a strongly-typed language such as Swift and Java), use "generics" to allow your LinkedList to hold data of any type (that is, allows for things like LinkedList<Integer> or LinkedList<Fruit>, etc.)
